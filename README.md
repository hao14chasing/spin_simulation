Hello everyone, please refer to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HZoNb6WUklaA5iSivsKnnZN-_pv9sPwQ?usp=sharing) for a more detailed simulation package :)

# Main Goal
The main goal is to use a publicity-accessible spin simulation code called *Spirit* ([M√ºller *et al*](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.224414)) to simulate the results obtained from the paper *Observation of a phase transition within the domain walls of ferromagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>* ([Lee *et al*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30460-y)). In this paper, Lee *et al* suggested that "what sets this compound apart is the giant value of its dimensionless anisotropy factor, *K*", I want to use the code to reproduce the observation that spin transforms **Bloch Wall** to **Linear Wall** and verify if it is truly caused by giant value of dimensionless anisotropy factor. (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)

Right now, I'm able to see a Bloch Wall

The characterization of Linear Wall is still under investigation...


# Simulation
## Main Folder
The main directory contains the core material used for simulation, including useful functions, documentation, and an overall usage example. **Updates are still underway. Stay Tuned!**

## Logging Folder
The logging folder contains the Spin Log, Magnetization Log, and Energy Log to be accessed for future reference.

## Analysis Folder
This folder is a thorough analysis of the result of some parameters used for simulation. The main example folder is
### J=6.79, K=6.7 Analysis
By setting Anisotropy and Exchange energy both to 6.79 meV, I see clear information of **Bloch Wall** üòÉ
### 100_100_2 Lattice
If dipole-dipole interaction is taken into consideration, then we should have more spins(i.e. layers of atoms) for a more accurate simulation. However, this simulation takes a very long long time(even just testing the curie temperature takes more than one day to runüòí), so the folder is still under updating. **Stay Tuned!**

## Reference Folder
This folder contains necessary papers that could be useful for simulation. It includes example simulation, simulation theory, and *Spirit* documentations, etc.

## Visualization Folder
This folder contains the overall spin structure with a 3D image, provided by *Spirit* built-in visualization tool. Example folder: Warmup Graph, Field Cool Graph, etc.

## Testing Folder
The testing folder contains unnecessary packages and code that I used only to understand the code better.
